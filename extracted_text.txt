than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook, product development, distribution, and pricing,
expected benefits of and applications for our software platforms, business strategy and plans (including strategy and plans relating to our Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”), sales and
marketing efforts, sales force, partnerships, and customers), investments in our business, market trends and market size, expectations regarding any current or potential customers, partnerships,
or other business relationships or initiatives, opportunities (including growth opportunities), our expectations regarding our existing and potential investments in, and commercial contracts with,
various entities, our expectations regarding macroeconomic events, our expectations regarding our share repurchase program, and positioning, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing.
Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
terminology such as “guidance,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “believe,” “hope,” “target,” “project,” “plan,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “could,” “intend,” “shall,”
and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or
results will be achieved, if at all. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control. Our
actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks detailed in our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You can locate these reports on our investor relations website (investors.palantir.com) or on the SEC website (www.sec.gov). If the risks or
uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, our results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Except as required by law,
we assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.
We use the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow margin; adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin; billings; adjusted operating income and
adjusted operating margin; operating income when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses and operating margin when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses; net income when excluding
one-time SAR-related expenses; adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”), diluted; EPS when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses, diluted; and adjusted expenses to help us evaluate our
business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other
companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations in that they do not
include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Thus, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the
most comparable GAAP measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial
measure, and to view these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

US government revenue grew +45% Y/Y and +7% Q/Q to $343 million
Revenue grew +36% Y/Y and +14% Q/Q to $828 million; +39% Y/Y and +14% Q/Q excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts
Rule of 40 score of 81%
Closed 129 deals of at least $1 million, 58 deals of at least $5 million, and 32 deals of at least $10 million

Closed a record-setting $803 million of US commercial total contract value (“TCV”), +134% Y/Y and +170% Q/Q
Adjusted EPS of $0.14
The term "Strategic Commercial Contracts" is as defined in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 5, 2024. Rule of 40 refers to the sum of our revenue growth rate year-over-year and our adjusted operating margin. The value of deals closed reflects the total contract value of contracts that have been entered
into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers and includes existing contractual obligations and unexercised contract options available to those customers. Adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow margin exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation and
purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potential lifetime value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the time of
contract execution and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reporting period. Except as noted below, TCV and RDV each presume the exercise of all contract options available to our customers and no termination of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are
subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some portion of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ financial
condition, including the consideration of such customers’ ability and intention to pay, and whether such contracts continue to meet the criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors. Adjusted EPS excludes stock-based compensation expense, related employer payroll taxes, and income tax effects and adjustments.

Net dollar retention was 120% in Q4 2024.
Net dollar retention is calculated as (a) revenue for the trailing twelve months as of each period attributable to the customers as counted for the prior trailing twelve months divided by (b) revenue for the prior trailing twelve months recognized from those same customers.
Remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) reflects the values of contracts that have been entered into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers and represents non-cancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances,
© 2025 Palantir Technologies Inc. amounts that will be invoiced. We have elected the practical expedient, as permitted under Accounting Standards Codification 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less.
